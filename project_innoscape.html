        <h3>Project InnoScape</h3>
        <p>
          InnoScape Tech Solutions is a rapidly growing technology company that
          specializes in software development and innovative tech solutions. As
          the company expands its services and reaches a broader audience, there
          is a need for a comprehensive branding redesign to better reflect its
          cutting-edge approach and values.

          <h3>Design Objectives:</h3>
          <h5>&#9679; LOGO REDESIGN</h5>
          <p>
            The current logo lacks a modern and dynamic feel. We need a new logo
            that represents innovation, reliability, and the forward-thinking
            nature of InnoScape Tech Solutions.

          <h3>&#10687; Challenges</h3>
          <h5>Balancing Innovation and Professionalism:</h5>
          <p>
            InnoScape Tech Solutions wants to be perceived as both innovative
            and professional. Striking the right balance in the design elements
            to convey this dual identity is a challenge.
          </p>

          <h5>Client Preference:</h5>
          <p>
            While the client has expressed a desire for a modern look, they also
            have a preference for a certain color (blue) used in their current
            branding. Finding a way to incorporate this preference while
            modernizing the overall color palette is a challenge.

          <!-- <h3>Design Objective:</h3> -->
          <h5>&#9679; COLOR PALETTE</h5>
          <p>
            The existing color scheme feels outdated. So I revitalized the
            current color scheme with a contemporary and dynamic palette
            reflecting shades such as #0E131F for a deep, sophisticated base,
            #FEF5EF to infuse a touch of modernity and warmth, and #4D7EA8 to
            introduce a vibrant and tech-inspired accent. This refreshed color
            palette aims to resonate with the technology sector while
            maintaining broad appeal for corporate clients and individual
            consumers alike.

            Evaluated and suggested a new typography style that complements the
            logo and overall brand identity. The chosen fonts should be easy to
            read in both digital and print formats.
